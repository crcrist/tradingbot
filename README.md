# Stock Prediction API - Complete ML Pipeline

A high-performance stock price prediction API built with FastAPI and Random Forest machine learning models. This project demonstrates a production-ready approach to building intelligent financial APIs through a structured 6-phase development methodology.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This API provides **real-time stock price predictions** using machine learning models trained on historical market data and technical indicators. The system fetches live market data, applies feature engineering with technical analysis, and uses Random Forest models to predict next-day price movements with confidence scoring.

### Why This Approach?

We built this system using a **phased development methodology** for several key reasons:

1. **Risk Mitigation**: Each phase validates core functionality before adding complexity
2. **Iterative Learning**: Allows testing assumptions at each layer (data → caching → ML → optimization)
3. **Production Readiness**: Ensures each component is robust before building on top
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes debugging and updates easier
5. **Scalability**: Architecture designed to handle real-world trading volumes

## 🚀 Current Status: **Phase 4 Complete**

**Feature Engineering**: Technical analysis indicators for ML training
- Moving averages (5-day, 20-day) for trend analysis  
- RSI (Relative Strength Index) for momentum
- Volume ratios and volatility measures
- Price change percentages and trend indicators

**ML Models**: Random Forest regressors for price prediction
- Trained on 252 trading days (1 year) of historical data
- Predicts next-day price change percentage
- Models saved with joblib for fast loading
- Confidence scoring based on validation performance

**Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer caching for enterprise performance

## 🚨 Error Handling & Reliability

### Multi-Layer Fallback Strategy
1. **Live Data Failure**: Use cached data if available
2. **Cache Miss**: Fetch from Alpha Vantage with retry logic
3. **API Rate Limits**: Exponential backoff with jitter
4. **ML Model Failure**: Fallback to simple statistical predictions
5. **Complete System Failure**: Return last-known-good data

### Production Considerations (Phase 4 Ready)
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in Alpha Vantage rate limit respect with connection pooling
- **Data Validation**: Outlier detection and vectorized data cleaning
